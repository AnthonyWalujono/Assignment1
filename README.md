# Assignment1
Programming Languages Assignment1

Deadline 1
I implemented the addP function (add positive numbers) in Part 1, and I added a subtraction function to the calculator. The difficulties that I ran into was trying to figure out the equation for addP and compiling. I worked with Paul a bit on this project. I have accomplished figuring out addP. I tested my program using haskell and bnfc. The intersting observation was how obvious the subtraction part of the calculator was. This part of the assignment connects with everything.
Submitted on 9/21.

Deadline 2
I implemented the remaining functions in Part 1, and I added more functions (Divide, Modulus, Exponent, Negative, Absolute)
on Part 2. The difficulties I encounter was some of the functions on arithmetic.hs and figuring out the absolute function on Part 2.
I have accomplished everything that I did for the assignment. I tested part 1 with haskell and part 2 with bnfc. The interesting part was using the if-else statement on the absolute.
Submitted on 10/2.
