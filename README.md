Deadline 1
I implemented the addP function (add positive numbers) in Part 1, and I added a subtraction fnction to the calculator. The difficulties that I ran into was trying to figure out the equation for addP and compiling. I worked with Paul a bit on this project. I have accomplished figuring out addP. I tested my program using haskell and bnfc. The intersting observation was how obvious the subtraction part of the calculator was. This part of the assignment connects with everything.
Submitted on 9/21.
