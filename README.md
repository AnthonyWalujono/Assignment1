# what is this project?:
This repository is for the course CPSC 354 known as "Programming Language Lamda Calculus" where we
go over many theories of what Programming Language is to how it works behind the scene.

This course goes over a wide variety of topics ranging from Arithmetic to Theories. The goal is to understand how programming languages work with the possibility of 
designing our own programming language. By the end of this project, the outcome of the course would lead to us being able to
understand the basic ideas of advance topics such as dependent types, theorem proving, and mathematics as a specification.
